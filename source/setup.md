## Step 10: Test it
Now, you have already connected a new chatbot to your Facebook page using our Chatbotman app. You can send "Hey" to your Facebook page using [Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/) and see whether you get the default fallback response by the chatbot.

Usually, you may get a response like "**I didn't get that. Can you say it again?**" which is because your agent have no intent for handling your message. To make the chatbot really works, you need to read the [documentation](https://dialogflow.com/docs/getting-started/building-your-first-agent) by Dialogflow to learn how to create intents and entities in your Dialogflow agent.
