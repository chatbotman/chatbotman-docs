## Step 3: Campaign Details
In the **Campaign Details** section, we assume that you need to choose whether the broadcast message is a **promotional message** or **non-promotional message** since it is under different policies. Currently, only **non-promotional message** is available as Chatbotman is still on beta version. For more details, please read [Messenger Platform - Platform Policy Overview](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/policy/policy-overview).

If **Non-promotional Message** is chosen, you also need to specify the type of the broadcast message. By default, **Non-promotional Subscription** is selected. However, you can change to other types such as **Pairing Update**, **Game Event** if you want. For more details, please read [Messenger Platform - Sending Messages](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages#message_types).

If you have finished this step, click **Next** to continue.
