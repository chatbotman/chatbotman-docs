## What is Chatbotman?

Chatbotman is a platform that aims to help chatbot developers to build intelligent chatbot by providing the best integration between [Dialogflow](https://www.dialogflow.com) and Facebook Messenger. You can connect to your Facebook Page to your Dialogflow agent with a single click and enjoy all the integrations we have developed for Facebook messengers.

You can also build extension to further extend your chatbot capability by connecting to your own integration. The best way to start building your extension is to clone our [sample extension project](https://github.com/chatbotman/extension-what-time-is-it).
